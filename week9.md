# Purpose:
The purpose of each coding assignment is to help you master the concepts presented each week by answering problems using those concepts.

# Due Date:
Each Coding Assignment is due by midnight on Saturday.

# Late Policy:
Assignments turned in late will result in a 10% deduction of points.

# Tips:
- Start the assignment early in the week and before your live class.
- Bring questions to your class, to office hours or a mentor session.
- Be sure to follow all instructions as there are no resubmissions or regrades.

# Instructions:
In Visual Studio Code, write the code that accomplishes the objectives listed below and ensures that the code compiles and runs as directed. Comment your code, to prove that you understand what you have written -- this is required! Create a new repository on GitHub for this week's assignments and push your code to the repository. Create a Video showcasing your assignment. Submit the two URL links for the GitHub repo and Video in the Text box.

# Coding Steps:
For the final project you will be creating an automated version of the classic card game WAR! There are many versions of the game WAR. In this version there are only 2 players. You do not need to do anything special when there is a tie in a round. Think about how you would build this project and write your plan down. Consider classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as what properties and methods they may include. You do not need to accept any user input, when you run your code, the entire game should play out instantly without any user input inside of your browser's console.

The completed project should, when executed, do the following:
- Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
- Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
- The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point.
- Ties result in zero points for both Players.
- After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.

The following is extra credit (10pts)
- Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions you write.

# Video Steps:
Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed. This video should be done using screen share and voice over. This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend. You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording. This will create a video recording on your computer. This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube. Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED! If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
